# Vehicle Manager App (Python)

A **Python console application** for managing a fleet of vehicles (Cars and Motorcycles).  

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python, with features for **adding, listing, and persisting vehicle data**.

- Add new vehicles (Car or Motorcycle) with attributes like make, model, year, and fuel type.
- Display all vehicles in a clean formatted list.
- Save vehicle data to a file and load it back.
- Extensible design for adding new vehicle types or features.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Method Overriding)
- **File Handling:** Text-based storage for vehicle data.
